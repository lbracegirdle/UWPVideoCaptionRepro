WEBVTT

1
00:00:01,551 --> 00:00:05,321
These captions are in WebVTT format.

2
00:00:05,321 --> 00:00:10,326
The default position is the bottom of the screen.

3
00:00:10,326 --> 00:00:14,631
VTT files take position instructions as space separated values 
after the time index like this... line:10% align:center

4
00:00:14,631 --> 00:00:18,034
line:10% should display the caption at the top, but it doesn't.
It appears off screen as we will demonstrate in the next caption.

5
00:00:18,034 --> 00:00:20,070 line:10% position:50% align:center
Like this.

6
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:25,208
...which makes it impossible to position the caption
anywhere other than bottom centre.
